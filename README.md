# End2End-HTR-Pipeline

This repository contains all files to train end-to-end recognition of handwritten words from school notebooks in Russian and English. With the end-to-end system, you can convert your school notebook to text without quality loss. This repository does not include any models. 

A good [dataset](https://github.com/abdoelsayed2016/HKR_Dataset) to train the model.
